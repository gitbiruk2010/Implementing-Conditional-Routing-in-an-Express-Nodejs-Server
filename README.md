How to Run the Server

To run the server, follow these steps:

    Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

    Clone this repository or download the project files.

    Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

    Install the required dependencies using npm:

    bash

npm install

Start the server by running the following command:

bash

    node app.js

    You will see a console log message confirming that the server has started on the specified port.

    Open a web browser or use an API testing tool to access the following routes:

        /foo: This route demonstrates conditional routing. It will randomly respond with either "sometimes this" or "and sometimes that."

        Any other undefined routes: Accessing routes other than /foo will result in a "404 - Not Found" response.

How Conditional Routing is Implemented

Conditional routing in this server is implemented as follows:

    Two route handlers are defined for the /foo path.

        The first route handler uses Math.random() to randomly choose between two responses:
            "sometimes this"
            Passing control to the next route handler using next().

        The second route handler for /foo always responds with "and sometimes that."

    When you access the /foo route, it will either provide one of the two responses based on the random choice or always return "and sometimes that."

    For routes other than /foo that are not explicitly defined, a 404 error handler is set up to return a "404 - Not Found" response.
